            <p>a passionate developer with a dream to make my mark on the world! I hail from the beautiful and welcoming country of Jordan. From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by art, colors, and design—I love creating visually appealing and functional works (I even designed a game UI once!). This passion led me to Full-Stack Development, where I can combine my love for creativity with problem-solving. Plus, it helps that I don’t have to deal with too much math or stats, you know!</p>
            <p>I’m all about doing things right and striving for the best possible outcome in everything I create. My first page (this page) is now on GitHub, and the fact the I want to update this page over and over is my sign that I'm eager to seek perfection and knowledge, despite perfection is not possible. That just the beginning, I can’t wait to see where this journey takes me. Let’s build something amazing together!</p>

            <dt>UI/UX Designer</dt>
            <dd>My project in the university was a game, and my role was the main designer, I did design the whole set of UI/UX design of the game in addition to make the promotional poster.</dd>
            <dt>Freelance Translator</dt>
            <dd>I stated my journey as a small comics translator, spending two years full of learning and dedication in that domain which was something I truly love, then I leaved that domain to start a freelance job <a href="https://trekmedics.org/" target="_blank">Trek Medics International</a> as a part of network of translators to translate <a href="https://trekmedics.org/beacon/">Beacon</a>.</dd>
            <dt>Digital Painter</dt>
            <dd>I can consider this more as a hobby, one of the first things I discovered about myself very long time ago, something opened the doors to discover my true passion. I'm planning to invest more in it and learn more to -someday- proudly call it a skill.</dd>
            <dt>Artist/Animator (My goal!)...</dt>
            <dd>Well, this is my next step after finishing the road of becoming a full-stack developer, its not the main focus for me even after that, but its a key to open doors I might be interested in the future.</dd>
