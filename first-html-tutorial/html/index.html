        <h2>My HTML Journey</h2>
        <p>I know that I'm just practising here, but I would take the chance to talk a little bit about my passion for the career, so I hope you find joy reading this simple page and honest words from a simple man. By the way, mostly I will update this page from time to time as I consider as a memo to document my learning journey (I hope I don't abandon it), and to talk some nonsense if you don't mind that ^^.</p>

          <h3>The Beginning: Why Full-Stack Development?</h3>
          <p>I'm a translator of visual stories and a simple small digital painter, in addition to my love for computers, do not all of these make sense to go ahead a choose Full-Stack Development as my career? I think so, and I will be honest I'm afraid of diving into the world of design and to try being 'creative' or dealing with the empty canvases to build appealing and user-friendly UI/UX! but as a painter I understand that 'creativity' comes from always studying and <strong>practising</strong>.</p>
          <p>I don't know where the future will take me by this choice nor the time I will be investing in this learning journey, but I hope for all the good luck along the way until I achieve my goal, Inshallah I gonna do it, I don't see myself in another place other than that career, and I'm really would to hear from you guys and eager to hear your feedbacks on my journey, my projects as well.</p>

          <h3>Pre-Journey: What was I doing? and what I did do to prepare for the journey?</h3>
          <div>
            <h4>Did I learn something from the university?</h4>
            <p>Since I (finally!!) graduated from the university a month ago (2025-2), let's talk a little bit about it! I would say that the highlight point is how the environment in there changes the way you think and see others, and how we deal and plan things as well, the person you are before the journey of the university is completely different than the one today, the change is tangible on our thoughts and actions, and that make me think the years of university are worth in the end, in addition to the network you build along the way. If you want my opinion weather I learned something practical from that experience, I would say no, but what the major taught me are how to think as a developer and having that IT-mindset when I embrace a journey to learn something in the domain, I'm grateful to that to be honest!</p>
            <p>Well, in my last years of university, I did what every guy would do after realizing that its time to be more responsible and dependent on himself, and that thing is to start part-time jobs, where I spent a good amount of time as a <a href="https://www.careem.com/" target="_blank"><abbr title="Ride-Hailing and Ordering App">Careem</abbr></a> driver (like Uber), but mostly I was doing my thing as a freelance translator for <a href="https://trekmedics.org/" target="_blank">Trek Medics International</a> (to this day, by the way), I love languages and I really had a good experience from that.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>So? What's next?</h4>
            <p>Well, after I graduated you would except that I had this idea in my mind of 'I want to become a full-stack developer!' dream, and I will lie, it was in my mind since long time ago, but I needed to start learning as fast as possible. Alhamdulillah, I did buy a new laptop and set my sights on goal of 'becoming the best full-stack developer in the world!', armed with patience and practice.</p>

          <h3>Present-2025: What I'm planning? What I did achieve until now?</h3>
          <div>
            <h4>I wanna share a little bit of my plans...</h4>
            <p>I'm planning to dedicate myself to create from 4 to 5 projects <time datetime="2025">this year</time>, each one of them is not easy task to do and requires a lot of efforts, but they are on the list to teach me unique set of complementary skills which will make my growth as a full-stack developer more efficient and forming a strong foundation for a fresh man like me, the goal is not to complete them all, but to make as much as I can.</p>
            <p>As a long-term goal, I'm planning to learn drawing and animation especially taking the skills I have right now (digital painting and UI design), those will push my boundaries to the sky (I believe), despite that I literally fear to throw myself into the world of design and <strong>arts</strong>, the number of creative people in that world and how they make arts looks easy plant in you that fear of wasting tremendous time in that world but to find out in the end that you don't belong to it, but to surrender to that fear is the beginning of the real fail, I will not think twice about my choice.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Do you want to share more?</h4>
            <p>That only the surface of my plans, things I wanted to share with the lovely people who are reading this right now, that will make me more confident in my plans, and more eager to make them reality.</p>
            <p>Finally (and not least), all what I did achieve for now is this simple page, my first web page on the internet, that for me something big, because it means that I'm on serious on my dream, and that I'm on the right track. This is will not the end of my words, and i'm sure that I will be updating this page ones in a while. Thank you all for reading all of that, the journey is long, so I'm in your all care ^^...</p>
